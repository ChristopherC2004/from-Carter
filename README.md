### Chess Boxing

I personally am not big into sports, and so I chose one that I just think is cool. I think chess boxing is cool because it combines chess a game thats very much about logic and **mental prowess** and boxing which is more about brawn and **physical prowess**. While not a popular sport I think it should be just because of how unique of a combination it is. To win someone either must knockout their opponent in boxing or must checkmate them in chess.
