### Chess Boxing

I personally am not big into sports, and so I chose one that I just think is cool. I think chess boxing is cool because it combines chess a game thats very much about logic and **mental prowess** and boxing which is more about brawn and **physical prowess**. While not a popular sport I think it should be just because of how unique of a combination it is. To win someone either must knockout their opponent in boxing or must checkmate them in chess.

## Jokey Quotes
> "I would say don't take advice from people like me who have gotten very lucky. We're very biased. You know, like Taylor Swift telling you to follow your dreams is like a lottery winner telling you, 'Liquidize your assets; buy Powerball tickets - it works!'"
-Bo Burnham

> "I fully embrace myself as a hypocrite."
-Bo Burnham
