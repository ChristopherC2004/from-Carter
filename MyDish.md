One of my favorite foods is a chicken quesadilla. I like chicken quesadillas simply because of how good the combination of cheese, chicken and tortilla tastes, you can't go wrong with how simple it is. It's simplicity is another reason I like them, they don't take long to make, and dont require much cleanup of pots and pans afterwards either.
